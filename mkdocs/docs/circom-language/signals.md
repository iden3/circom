# Signals & Variables

The arithmetic circuits built using circom operate on signals, which contain field elements in Z/pZ. Signals can be named with an identifier or can be stored in arrays and declared using the keyword signal. Signals can be defined as input or output, and are considered intermediate signals otherwise. 

```text
signal input in;
signal output out[N];
signal inter;
```

This small example declares an input signal with identifier `in`, an N-dimension array of output signals with identifier `out` and an intermediate signal with identifier `inter`.

## Types of Signal Assignments
Signals can only be assigned using the operations `<--` or `<==` (with the signal to be assigned occurring on the left hand side operation) and `-->` or `==>` (with the signal to be assigned occurring on the right hand side). All these operations are translated into an assignment in the witness generation code produced by the compiler. However, the key difference between the 'double arrow' assignments `<==` and `==>` and the 'single arrow' assignments `<--` and `-->` is that only the former adds a constraint to the R1CS system stating that the signal is equal to the assigned expression. Hence, using `<--` and `-->` is considered dangerous and strongly discouraged for non expert circom programmers, as it is the most common source of programming buggy ZK-protocols using circom.

The safe options for assignments are `<==` and `==>`, since the assigned value is the only solution to the constraint system. Using `<--` and `-->` should be avoided, and only used when the assigned expression cannot be included in an arithmetic constraint in R1CS, like in the following example.

```text
out[k] <-- (in >> k) & 1;
```
In such case, since `<--` and `-->` do not add any constraint to the R1CS system stating the relation between the signal and the assigned expression, it is crucial to add other constraints expressing such relation. To this end, circom allows to add constraints to the system using the operation `===`, whose use is explained in more detailed [here](constraint-generation.md). 

## Public and Private Signals
Signals are always considered private. The programmer can distinguish between public and private signals only when defining the main component, by providing the list of public input signals. 

```text
pragma circom 2.0.0;

template Multiplier2(){
   //Declaration of signals
   signal input in1;
   signal input in2;
   signal output out;
   out <== in1 * in2;
}

component main {public [in1,in2]} = Multiplier2();
```
Since circom 2.0.4, it is also allowed to initialize intermediate and output signals right after their declaration. Then, the previous example can be rewritten as follows:

```text
pragma circom 2.0.0;

template Multiplier2(){
   //Declaration of signals
   signal input in1;
   signal input in2;
   signal output out <== in1 * in2;
}

component main {public [in1,in2]} = Multiplier2();
```


This example declares input signals `in1` and `in2` of the main component as public signals.

In circom, all output signals of the main component are public (and cannot be made private), the input signals of the main component are private if not stated otherwise using the keyword public as above. The rest of the signals are all private and cannot be made public. 

Thus, from the programmer's point of view, only public input and output signals are visible from outside the circuit, and hence no intermediate signal can be accessed.

```text
pragma circom 2.0.0;

template A(){
   signal input in;
   signal outA; //We do not declare it as output.
   outA <== in;
}

template B(){
   //Declaration of signals
   signal output out;
   component comp = A();
   out <== comp.outA;
}

component main = B();
```

This code produces a compilation error since signal `outA` is not declared as an output signal, then it cannot be accessed and assigned to signal `out`.

Signals are immutable, which means that once they have a value assigned, this value cannot be changed any more. Hence, if a signal is assigned twice, a compilation error is generated. This can be seen in the next example where signal `out` is assigned twice, producing a compilation error.

```text
pragma circom 2.0.0;

template A(){
   signal input in;
   signal output outA; 
   outA <== in;
}

template B(){
   //Declaration of signals
   signal output out;
   out <== 0;
   component comp = A();
   comp.in <== 0;
   out <== comp.outA;
}

component main = B();
```

At compilation time, the content of a signal is always considered unknown (see [Unknowns](/circom-language/circom-insight/unknowns.md)), even if a constant is already assigned to them. The reason for that is to provide a precise \(decidable\) definition of which constructions are allowed and which are not, without depending on the power of the compiler to detect whether a signal has always a constant value or not. 

```text
pragma circom 2.0.0;

template A(){
   signal input in;
   signal output outA; 
   var i = 0; var out = 0;
   while (i < in){
    out++; i++;
   }
   outA <== out;
}

template B(){
 component a = A();
 a.in <== 3;
}

component main = B();
```

This example produces a compilation error since the value of signal `outA` depends on the value of signal `in`, even though such a value is the constant 3.

Signals can only be assigned using the operations `<--` or `<==` (see [Basic operators](../basic-operators)) with the signal on the left hand side and `-->` or `==>` (see [Basic operators](../basic-operators)) with the signal on the right hand side. The safe options are `<==` and `==>`, since they assign values and also generate constraints at the same time. Using `<--` and `-->` is, in general, dangerous and should only be used when the assigned expression cannot be included in a constraint, like in the following example.

```text
out[k] <-- (in >> k) & 1;
```
