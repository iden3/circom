# Writing circuits 

`circom` allows programmers to define the [constraints](../../circom-language/constraint-generation.md) that define the arithmetic circuit. All constraints must be of the form A\*B + C = 0, where A, B and C are linear combinations of signals. More details about these equations can be found [here](../../circom-language/constraint-generation.md). 

The arithmetic circuits built using `circom` operate on signals. Let us define our first circuit that simply multiplies two input signals and produces an output signal.

```text  
pragma circom 2.0.0;
  
/*This circuit template checks that c is the multiplication of a and b.*/  

template Multiplier2 () {  

   // Declaration of signals.  
   signal input a;  
   signal input b;  
   signal output c;  
     
   // Constraints.  
   c <== a * b;  
}
```

First, the `pragma` instruction is used to specify the compiler version. This is to ensure that the circuit is compatible with the compiler version indicated after the `pragma` instruction. Otherwise, the compiler will throw a warning. 

Then, we use the reserved keyword `template` to define the shape of a new circuit, called `Multiplier2`.  Now, we have to define its [signals](../../circom-language/signals.md). Signals can be named with an identifier, e.g.,  `a, b, c.`  In this circuit, we have two input signals`a, b` and an output signal `c`.  Finally, we use `<==` to set that the value of `c` is the result of multiplying the values of `a` and `b`.  Equivalently, we could have also used the operator `==>`, e.g., `a * b ==> c`.

Let us notice that in each template, we first declare its signals, and after that, the associated constraints.
