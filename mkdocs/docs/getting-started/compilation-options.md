If we use the command ```circom --help```, we can see all the options and flags that we can use during the compilation.

OPTIONS:
    -o, --output <output>                    Path to the directory where the output will be written [default: .]
    -p, --prime <prime>                      To choose the prime number to use to generate the circuit. Receives the
                                             name of the curve (bn128, bls12381, goldilocks, grumpkin, pallas, vesta) [default: bn128]
    -l <link_libraries>...                   Adds directory to library search path
        --O2round <simplification_rounds>    Maximum number of rounds of the simplification process

ARGS:
    <input>    Path to a circuit with a main component [default: ./circuit.circom]
```

In the following, we explain these options.


#####Flags and options related to the compiler's output
* Flag ```--r1cs``` outputs the constraints in R1CS format.
* Flag ```--sym``` outputs the witness in sym format.
* Flag ```--wasm``` produces a WebAssembly program that receives the private and public inputs and generates the circuit witness.
* Flag ```-c / --c``` produces a C++ program that receives the private and public inputs and generates the circuit witness.
* Flag ```--wat``` compiles the circuit to wat.
* Flag ```--json``` outputs the R1CS system in JSON format.
* Option ```-o / --output <output>``` allows to indicate the path to the directory where the output will be written. By default the path is ```.```. 

#####Flags and options related to the constraint generation process
* Flag ```--verbose``` shows logs with known values at compilation time during the constraint generation process. 
* Flag ```--inspect``` does an additional check over the R1CS system produced. (see [--inspect](../circom-language/code-quality/inspect)).
* Flag ```--use_old_simplification_heuristics``` allows to use an old heuristics of the optimization algorithm. However, it is not recommended since the new heuristics has produced better results in practice.


#####Flags and options related to the R1CS optimization
In the following, we explain the different optimizations that we can apply to the final R1CS during the constraint generation phase.

* Flag ```--O0``` does not apply any kind of simplification.
  
* Flag ```--O1``` removes two kinds of simple constraints: a) ```signal = K```, being K is a constant in $F_p$ and b) ```signal1 = signal2```, which usually appears when linking components inputs and outputs. 
  
* Flag ```--O2``` applies Gauss elimination to remove as many linear constraints as possible. After applying the substitutions discovered by the algorithm, non-linear constraints may become linear. Thus, the Gauss elimination is applied during several rounds until no more linear constraints are discovered.

* Option ```--O2round <simplification_rounds>``` is similar to ```--O2```but it limits the maximum number of rounds applied during the optimization. In ```<simplification_rounds>```, user needs to indicate the number of rounds. 

Only one of these flags/options must be used during the compilation.

#####Other flags and options
* Option ```-p, --prime <prime>``` allows the user indicate which prime must be used during the compilation. Currently, it admits six different primes: bn128, bls12381, goldilock, grumpkin, pallas and vesta. If not indicated, the default prime is bn128.

* Option ```-l <link_libraries>``` adds the provided directory in ```<link_libraries>```to the library search path. It is possible to add as much ```-l <link_libraries>``` as needed, but only one directory per option.

* Flag ```-v / --version``` prints the version information.
* Flag ```-h / --help``` prints the help information.
