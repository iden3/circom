# Compiling our circuit

   OPTIONS:
       -o, --output <output>                    Path to the directory where the output will be written [default: .]
       -p, --prime <prime>                      To choose the prime number to use to generate the circuit. Receives the
                                                name of the curve (bn128, bls12377, bls12381, goldilocks, grumpkin, pallas, secq256r1, vesta) [default: bn128]
    -l <link_libraries>...                   Adds directory to library search path
           --O2round <simplification_rounds>    Maximum number of rounds of the simplification process
   
   ARGS:
       <input>    Path to a circuit with a main component [default: ./circuit.circom]
```

We created a template called `Multiplier2` in [Writing our first circuit](../writing-circuits.md). 
However, to actually create a circuit, we have to create an instance of this template. To do so, create a file with the following content:

```text
pragma circom 2.0.0;

template Multiplier2() {
    signal input a;
    signal input b;
    signal output c;
    c <== a*b;
 }

 component main = Multiplier2();
```

After we write our arithmetic circuit using `circom`, we should save it in a file with the `.circom` extension. Remember that you can create your own circuits or use the templates from our library of circuits [`circomlib`](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib).

In our example, we create a file called *multiplier2.circom*.
Now is time to compile the circuit to get a system of arithmetic equations representing it. As a result of the compilation we will also obtain programs to compute the witness.
We can compile the circuit with the following command:

```text
circom multiplier2.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym --c
```

With these options we generate three types of files:

* `--r1cs`: it generates the file `multiplier2.r1cs` that contains the [R1CS constraint system](../../background/background.md#rank-1-constraint-system) of the circuit in binary format.
* `--wasm`: it generates the directory `multiplier2_js` that contains the `Wasm` code (multiplier2.wasm) and other files needed to generate the [witness](../../background/background.md#witness).
* `--sym` : it generates the file `multiplier2.sym` , a symbols file required for debugging or for printing the constraint system in an annotated mode.
* `--c` : it generates the directory `multiplier2_cpp` that contains several files (multiplier2.cpp, multiplier2.dat, and other common files for every compiled program  like main.cpp, MakeFile, etc)  needed to compile the C++ code to generate the witness. By default, this option generates an asm file that is incompatible with some architectures. To avoid producing asm files, the flag `--no_asm` must be activated.

We can use the option `-o` to specify the directory where these files are created. 

Since version 2.0.8, we can use the option `-l` to indicate the directory where the directive `include` should look for the circuits indicated.
