# Installing the circom ecosystem

## &#9888; Important deprecation note

The old `circom` compiler written in Javascript will be frozen, but it can still be downloaded from the [old circom repository](https://github.com/iden3/circom_old).

## Installing dependencies

You need several dependencies in your system to 
run `circom` and its associated tools.

   * The core tool is the `circom` compiler which is written in Rust.
   To have Rust available in your system, you can install `rustup`. If youâ€™re using Linux or macOS, open a terminal and enter the following command:

<!-- 
TODO remove the command and put a link to rustup site 
-->

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

   * We also distribute a series of npm packages so `Node.js` and some package manager like `npm` or `yarn` should be available in your system. Recent versions of `Node.js` include big integer support and web assembly compilers that help run code faster, so to get a better performance, install version 10 or higher.

## Installing circom

To install from our sources, clone the `circom` repository: 

```text
git clone https://github.com/iden3/circom.git
```

Enter the circom directory and use the cargo build to compile:

```text
cargo build --release
```

The installation takes around 3 minutes to be completed.
When the command successfully finishes, it generates the `circom` binary in the directory `target/release`. 
You can install this binary as follows (**Note**: Make sure you're still in the circom directory when running this command) :

```text
cargo install --path circom
```

The previous command will install the `circom` binary in the directory 
`$HOME/.cargo/bin`. 

Now, you should be able to see all the options of the executable by using the `help` flag:

```console
circom --help

USAGE:
    circom [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [--] [input]

FLAGS:
        --r1cs                                 Outputs the constraints in r1cs format

        --json                                 Outputs the constraints in json format
        --wat                                  Compiles the circuit to wat
    -c, --c                                    Compiles the circuit to C++
        --O0                                   No simplification is applied
        --O1                                   Only applies signal to signal and signal to constant simplification. This
                                               is the default option
        --O2                                   Full constraint simplification
        --verbose                              Shows logs during compilation
        --inspect                              Does an additional check over the constraints produced
        --use_old_simplification_heuristics    Applies the old version of the heuristics when performing linear
                                               simplification
        --simplification_substitution          Outputs the substitution applied in the simplification phase in json
                                               format
        --no_asm                               Does not use asm files in witness generation code in C++
        --no_init                              Removes initializations to 0 of variables ("var") in the witness
                                               generation code
    -h, --help                                 Prints help information
    -V, --version                              Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -o, --output <output>                    Path to the directory where the output will be written [default: .]
    -p, --prime <prime>                      To choose the prime number to use to generate the circuit. Receives the
                                             name of the curve (bn128, bls12377, bls12381, goldilocks, grumpkin, pallas,
                                             secq256r1, vesta) [default: bn128]
    -l <link_libraries>...                   Adds directory to library search path
        --O2round <simplification_rounds>    Maximum number of rounds of the simplification process
        --sanity_check <sanity_check>        Selects the level of sanity checks to be included in the witness generation

```

## Installing snarkjs <a id="installing-the-tools"></a>

`snarkjs` is a npm package that contains code to generate and validate ZK proofs from the artifacts produced by `circom`. 

You can install `snarkjs` with the following command:

```text
npm install -g snarkjs
```
