ZKPs came up first as a solution to privacy issues but they have lately also stood up as a perfect solution to scalability issues. As a result, these cryptographic proofs have become very attractive tools to the blockchain community, and the most efficient algorithms have already been deployed and integrated in several applications. A zero-knowledge proof is a protocol that enables one party, called the prover , to convince another, the verifier , that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the veracity of the statement. For example, a prover can create proofs for statements like the following: \"I know the private key that corresponds to this public key\" : in this case, the proof would not reveal any information about the private key. \"I know a private key that corresponds to a public key from this list\" : as before, the proof would not reveal information about the private key but in this case, the associated public key would also remain private. \"I know the preimage of this hash value\" : in this case, the proof would show that the prover knows the preimage but it would not reveal any information about the value of that preimage. \"This is the hash of a blockchain block that does not produce negative balances\" : in this case, the proof would not reveal any information about the amount, origin or destination of the transactions included in the block. Non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs \\(NIZK\\) are a particular type of zero-knowledge proofs in which the prover can generate the proof without interaction with the verifier. NIZK protocols are very suitable for Ethereum blockchain applications, because they allow a smart contract to act as a verifier . This way, anyone can generate a proof and send it as part of a transaction to the smart contract, which can perform some action depending on whether the proof is valid or not. In this context, the most preferable NIZK are zk-SNARK proofs \\(Zero-knowledge Succinct Non Interactive ARgument of Knowledge\\) , a set of non-interactive zero-knowledge protocols that have succinct proof size and sublinear verification time . The importance of these protocols is double: on the one hand, they help improve privacy guarantees, but on the other, their small proof size has been used in scalability solutions. Arithmetic circuits Like most ZKPs, zk-SNARKs permit proving computational statements , but they cannot be applied to the computational problem directly, the statement first needs to be converted into the right form. Specifically, zk-SNARKs requires the computational statement to be modeled with an arithmetic circuit. Although it may not always be obvious how to do this conversion, most computational problems we care about can easily be converted into arithmetic circuits. An F_p -arithmetic circuit is a circuit consisting of set of wires that carry values from the field F_p and connect them to addition and multiplication gates modulo p . \ud83d\udc49 Remember that given a prime number p , the finite field F_p consists of the set of numbers {0,...,p-1} on which we can add and multiply these numbers modulo p . For example, the finite field F_7 consists of the set of numbers {0,...,6} on which we can add and multiply numbers modulo 7 . An easy way to understand how operating modulo 7 works, is to think of a clock of 7 hours in which we do not care about how many times the hands have turned the clock, only what time they mark. In other words, we only care about the reminder of dividing by 7. For instance: 15 modulo 7 = 1 , since 15 = 7 + 7 + 1 7 modulo 7 = 0 4*3 modulo 7 = 5 , since 4*3 = 12 = 7 + 5 Signals of a circuit So, an arithmetic circuit takes some input signals that are values between 0,...,p-1 and performs additions and multiplications between them modulo the prime p . The output of every addition and multiplication gate is considered an intermediate signal , except for the last gate of the circuit, the output of which , is the output signal of the circuit. To generate and validate zk-SNARK proofs in Ethereum , we need to work with F_p -arithmetic circuits, taking the prime: p = 21888242871839275222246405745257275088548364400416034343698204186575808495617 In the figure below, we have defined an F_7 -arithmetic circuit that performs the operation: out = a*b + c . The circuit has 5 signals: the signals a , b and c are input signals, d is an intermediate signal and the out signal is the output of the circuit. \u200b In order to use zk-SNARK protocols, we need to describe the relation between signals as a system of equations that relate variables with gates. From now on, the equations that describe the circuit will be called constraints , and you can think of them as conditions that signals of that circuit must satisfy. Rank-1 constraint system If we have an arithmetic circuit with signals s_1,...,s_n , then we define a constraint as an equation of the following form: (a_1*s_1 + ... + a_n*s_n) * (b_1*s_1 + ... + b_n*s_n) + (c_1*s_1 + ... + c_n*s_n) = 0 Note that constraint must be quadratic, linear or constant equations , and sometimes, by doing small modifications \\(like a change of variable or gathering two constraints\\) , it is possible to reduce the number of constraints or variables. In general, circuits will have several constraints \\(typically, one per multiplicative gate\\) . The set of constraints describing the circuit is called rank-1 constraint system \\(R1CS\\) : (a_11*s_1 + ... + a_1n*s_n)*(b_11*s_1 + ... + b_1n*s_n) + (c_11*s_1 + ... + c_1n*s_n) = 0 (a_21*s_1 + ... + a_2n*s_n)*(b_21*s_1 + ... + b_2n*s_n) + (c_21*s_1 + ... + c_1n*s_n) = 0 (a_31*s_1 + ... + a_3n*s_n)*(b_31*s_1 + ... + b_3n*s_n) + (c_31*s_1 + ... + c_1n*s_n) = 0 ... (a_n1*s_1 + ... + a_nm*s_n)*(b_n1*s_1 + ... + b_nm*s_n) + (c_n1*s_1 + ... + c_nm*s_n) = 0 Remember that operations inside the circuit are performed modulo a certain prime p . So, all equations above are defined modulo p . In the previous example, the R1CS of our circuit consists of the following two equations: d = a*b modulo 7 out = d+c modulo 7 In this case, by replacing directly the variable d , we can gather the two equations into a single one: out = a*b + c modulo 7 The nice thing about circuits, is that although most zero-knowledge protocols have an inherent complexity that can be overwhelming for many developers, the design of arithmetic circuits is clear and neat . \ud83d\udc49 With circom , you design your own circuits with your own constraints, and the compiler outputs the R1CS representation that you will need for your zero-knowledge proof. Zero-knowledge permits proving circuit satisfiability . What this means is, that you can prove that you know a set of signals that satisfy the circuit, or in other words, that you know a solution to the R1CS. This set of signals is called witness . Witness Given a set of inputs, the calculation of the intermediate and output signals is pretty straightforward. So, given any set of inputs, we can always calculate the rest of signals. So, why should we talk about circuit satisfiability? The key aspect of zero-knowledge proofs, is that it allows you to compute these circuits without revealing information about the signals. For instance, imagine that in the previous circuit, the input a is a private key and the input b is the corresponding public key. You may be okay with revealing b but you certainly do not want to reveal a . If we define a as a private input, b , c as public inputs and out as a public output, with zero-knowledge we are able to prove, without revealing its value, that we know a private input a such that, for certain public values b , c and out , the equation a*b + c = out mod 7 holds. Note that we could easily deduce the value of a by isolating it from the other signals. It is important to design circuits that keep the privacy of the private inputs and prevent deducing them from the R1CS. An assignment of the signals is called a witness . For example, {a = 2, b = 6, c = -1, out = 4} would be a valid witness for the circuit. The assignment {a = 1, b = 2, c = 1, out = 0} would not be a valid witness, since it does not satisfy the equation a*b - c = out . Summary \u200b In summary, zk-SNARK proofs are an specific type of zero-knowledge proofs that allow you to prove that you know a a set of signals \\(witness\\) that match all the constraints of a circuit without revealing any of the signals except the public inputs and the outputs.","title":"Background in ZK"},{"location":"background/background/#background","text":"","title":"Background"},{"location":"background/background/#zero-knowledge-proofs","text":"Recently, a set of cryptographic primitives called zero-knowledge proofs \\(ZKPs\\) agitated the world of public blockchains and distributed ledgers.

They have the standard semantics but the arithmetic operators applied to numeric values work modulo p. The precedence and association of the operators are like in Rust (defined here ). Expressions can be built using the next operators, but the conditional operator ?_:_ can only occur at the top level. Field Elements A field element is a value in the domain of Z/pZ, where p is the prime number set by default to p = 21888242871839275222246405745257275088548364400416034343698204186575808495617. As such, field elements are operated in arithmetic modulo p. The circom language is parametric to this number, and it can be changed without affecting the rest of the language (using GLOBAL_FIELD_P ). Conditional expressions Boolean_condition ? true_value : false_value var z = x>y? x : y; This conditional expression is not allowed in a nested form, hence can only be used at the top level. Boolean operators Next boolean operators are allowed: Operator Example Explanation && a && b Boolean operator AND || a || b Boolean operator OR ! ! a Boolean operator NEGATION Relational operators The definition of relational operators < , > , <= , >= , == , != depends on the mathematical function val(x) which is defined as follows: val(z) = z-p if p/2 +1 <= z < p val(z) = z, otherwise. According to this function, the definition of the relational operators is as follows: `x < y` is defined as val(x % p) < val(y % p) `x > y` is defined as val(x % p) > val(y % p) `x <= y` is defined as val(x % p) <= val(y % p) `x >= y` is defined as val(x % p) >= val(y % p) where <, >, <=, >= are the comparison of integers. Arithmetic operators All arithmetic operations work modulo p. We have the next operators: Operator Example Explanation + a + b Arithmetic addition modulo p - a - b Arithmetic subtraction modulo p * a * b Arithmetic multiplication modulo p ** a ** b Power modulo p / a / b Multiplication by the inverse modulo p \\ a \\ b Quotient of the integer division % a % b Remainder of the integer division There are operators that combine arithmetic operators with a final assignment.

Syntactic sugar for a += 1 -- a-- Unit decrement. Syntactic sugar for a -= 1 Bitwise operators All bitwise operators are performed modulo p. Operator Example Explanation & a & b Bitwise AND | a | b Bitwise OR ~ ~a Complement 254 bits ^ a ^ b XOR 254 bits >> a >> 4 Right shift operator << a << 4 Left shift operator The shift operations also work modulo p and are defined as follows \\(assuming p>=7\\) .

In case it is, the value of output signal out is 1 . 0 , otherwise. Note here that we use the intermediate signal inv to compute the inverse of the value of in or 0 if it does not exist. If in is 0, then in*inv is 0, and the value of out is 1 . Otherwise, in*inv is always 1 , then out is 0 . pragma circom 2.0.0; template Num2Bits(n) { signal input in; signal output out[n]; var lc1=0; var e2=1; for (var i = 0; i<n; i++) { out[i] <-- (in >> i) & 1; out[i] * (out[i] -1 ) === 0; lc1 += out[i] * e2; e2 = e2+e2; } lc1 === in; } component main {public [in]}= Num2Bits(3); This templates returns a n-dimensional array with the value of in in binary.

Finally, the result of a function call with unknown parameters is unknown. pragma circom 2.0.0; function F(n){ return n*n; } template A(n1, n2){ signal input in; signal output out; var end = F(in); var j = 0; for(var i = 0; i < end; i++){ j += 2; } out <== j; } component main = A(1,2); Var end is considered unknown since it is the result of a function F called with the unknown parameter in . The compilation of the previous code produces the error \"Non quadratic constraints are not allowed! \", since the value of j depends on the value of end . The key point for the compiler in the constructive phase is that the generation of constraints cannot depend on conditions \\(expressions\\) that are unknown.This is imposed on all statements . This can be seen both in the previous example and the next one: pragma circom 2.0.0; template wrong(){ signal input in; var y = 0; var i = 0; while(i < in){ i++; y += y; } out <== y; } component main = wrong();","title":"Unknowns"},{"location":"circom-language/code-quality/code-assertion/","text":"Code Assertion assert(bool_expression); This statement introduces conditions to be checked at execution time.

All constraints must be of the form A*B + C = 0, where A, B and C are linear combinations of signals. More details about these equations can be found here . Writing our first circuit The arithmetic circuits built using circom operate on signals. Let us define our first circuit that simply multiplies two input signals and produces an output signal. pragma circom 2.0.0; /*This circuit multiplies in1 and in2.*/ template Multiplier2 () { // Declaration of signals. signal input in1; signal input in2; signal output out; // Statements. out <== in1 * in2; } component main = Multiplier2(); First, the pragma instruction is used to specify the compiler version. This is to ensure that the circuit is compatible with the compiler version indicated after the pragma instruction. Otherwise, the compiler will throw a warning. Then, we use the reserved keyword template to define our new circuit, called Multiplier2 . Now, we have to define its signals . Signals can be named with an identifier, e.g., in1, in2, out. In this circuit, we have two input signals in1, in2 and an output signal out . Finally, we use <== to set that the value of out is the result of multiplying the values of in1 and in2 . Equivalently, we could have also used the operator ==> , e.g., in1 * in2 ==> out . Let us notice that in each circuit, we first declare its signals, and after that, the assignments to set the value of the output signals. Compiling the circuit Once you have the compiler installed you can see the available options as follows: circom --help Circom Compiler 2.0 IDEN3 Compiler for the Circom programming language USAGE: circom [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [input] FLAGS: -h, --help Prints help information --inspect Does an additional check over the constraints produced --O0 No simplification is applied -c, --c Compiles the circuit to c --json outputs the constraints in json format --r1cs outputs the constraints in r1cs format --sym outputs witness in sym format --wasm Compiles the circuit to wasm --wat Compiles the circuit to wat --O1 Only applies var to var and var to constant simplification -V, --version Prints version information OPTIONS: --O2 <full_simplification> Full constraint simplification [default: full] -o, --output <output> Path to the directory where the output will be written [default: .] ARGS: <input> Path to a circuit with a main component [default: ./circuit.circom] We created a template called Multiplier2 in Writing our first circuit . However, to actually create a circuit, we have to create an instance of this template. To do so, create a file with the following content: pragma circom 2.0.0; template Multiplier2() { signal input a; signal input b; signal output c; c <== a*b; } component main = Multiplier2(); After we write our arithmetic circuit using circom , we should save it in a file with the .circom extension. Remember that you can create your own circuits or use the templates from our library of circuits circomlib . In our example, we create a file called multiplier2.circom . Now is time to compile the circuit to get a system of arithmetic equations representing it. As a result of the compilation we will also obtain programs to compute the witness. We can compile the circuit with the following command: circom multiplier2.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym --c With these options we generate three types of files: --r1cs : it generates the file multiplier2.r1cs that contains the R1CS constraint system of the circuit in binary format. --wasm : it generates the directory multiplier2_js that contains the Wasm code (multiplier2.wasm) and other files needed to generate the witness . --sym : it generates the file multiplier2.sym , a symbols file required for debugging or for printing the constraint system in an annotated mode. --c : it generates the directory multiplier2_cpp that contains several files (multiplier2.cpp, multiplier2.dat, and other common files for every compiled program like main.cpp, MakeFile, etc) needed to compile the C code to generate the witness. We can use the option -o to specify the directory where these files are created. Extending our multiplier to three inputs Building on top of the 2-input multiplier, we can build a 3-input multiplier. pragma circom 2.0.0; template Multiplier2(){ /*Code from the previous example.*/ } //This circuit multiplies in1, in2, and in3. template Multiplier3 () { //Declaration of signals and components. signal input in1; signal input in2; signal input in3; signal output out; component mult1 = Multiplier2(); component mult2 = Multiplier2(); //Statements. mult1.in1 <== in1; mult1.in2 <== in2; mult2.in1 <== mult1.out; mult2.in2 <== in3; out <== mult2.out; } component main = Multiplier3(); As expected, we first declare three input signals in1, in2, in3, and an output signal out and two instances of Multiplier2 . Instantiations of templates are done using the keyword component . We need an instance mult1 to multiply in1 and in2 . In order to assign the values of the input signals of mult1 we use the dot notation \".\" . Once mult1.in1 and mult1.in2 have their values set, then the value of mult1.out is computed. This value can be now used to set the input value of mult2 of the second instance of Multiplier2 to multiply in1*in2 and in3 obtaining the final result in1*in2*in3 . Finally, every execution starts from an initial main component defined as follows. component main {public [in1,in2,in3]} = Multiplier3(); Here, we indicate that the initial component for our first circom program is the circuit Multiplier3 which has three public signals: in1, in2 and in3 . In circom, all output signals of the main component are public (and cannot be made private), the input signals of the main component are private if not stated otherwise using the keyword public as avobe. The rest of signals are all private and cannot be made public. Extending our multiplier to N inputs When defining a template, we can use parameters to build generic circuits. These parameters must have a known value at the moment of the instantiation of the template. Following up the previous example, we can implement an N-input multiplier, where N is a parameter. pragma circom 2.0.0; template Multiplier2(){ /*Code from the previous example.*/ } template MultiplierN (N){ //Declaration of signals and components. signal input in[N]; signal output out; component comp[N-1]; //Statements. for(var i = 0; i < N-1; i++){ comp[i] = Multiplier2(); } // ... some more code (see below) } component main = MultiplierN(4); In addition to the parameter N , two well-known concepts appear in this fragment of code: arrays and integer variables . As we have seen for a 3-input multiplier, we need 3 input signals and 2 components of Multiplier2 . Then, for an N-input multiplier, we need an N-dimensional array of input signals and an \\(N-1\\) -dimensional array of components of Multiplier2 . We also need an integer variable i to instantiate each component comp[i] . Once this is done, we have to set the signals for each component as follows: comp[0].in1 <== in[0]; comp[0].in2 <== in[1]; for(var i = 0; i < N-2; i++){ comp[i+1].in1 <== comp[i].out; comp[i+1].in2 <== in[i+2]; } out <== comp[N-2].out; } Similarly to Multiplier3 , each output signal of a component becomes one of the input signals of the next component. Finally, out is set as the output signal of the last component and its value will be in[0]*in[1]*...*in[N-1] . Finally, we define as main component a MultiplierN with N = 3 . component main {public [in]} = MultiplierN(3); pragma circom 2.0.0; template Multiplier2(){ //Declaration of signals. signal input in1; signal input in2; signal output out; //Statements. out <== in1 * in2; } template Multiplier3 () { //Declaration of signals. signal input in1; signal input in2; signal input in3; signal output out; component mult1 = Multiplier2(); component mult2 = Multiplier2(); //Statements. mult1.in1 <== in1; mult1.in2 <== in2; mult2.in1 <== mult1.out; mult2.in2 <== in3; out <== mult2.out; } template MultiplierN (N){ //Declaration of signals. signal input in[N]; signal output out; component comp[N-1]; //Statements. for(var i = 0; i < N-1; i++){ comp[i] = Multiplier2(); } comp[0].in1 <== in[0]; comp[0].in2 <== in[1]; for(var i = 0; i < N-2; i++){ comp[i+1].in1 <== comp[i].out; comp[i+1].in2 <== in[i+2]; } out <== comp[N-2].out; } component main {public [in]} = MultiplierN(3); Writing a circuit for binary checks Let us build a circuit that checks if the input signal is binary. In case it is, the circuit returns an output signal with the same value than in . pragma circom 2.0.0; template binaryCheck () { // Declaration of signals. signal input in; signal output out; // Statements. in * (in-1) === 0; out <== in; } component main = binaryCheck(); After declaring the signals of the circuit, we use the operator === to introduce the constraint in * (in -1) = 0 . The solutions of this constraint are in = 0 and in = 1 . This means that the constraint has solution if and only if the input signal is binary. The instruction out <== in not only assigns the value of signal in to signal out , but it also adds the constraint out = in to the set of constraints that define the circuit. Then, when both constraints have solution, it is guaranteed that the output signal is binary. Sometimes, we only want to assign the value of a signal but not adding the corresponding constraint. In this case, we will use the operator <-- and --> . The differences between <--/--> and <==/==> are described here . Writing a logic gate AND with two inputs We are going to use the circuits Multiplier2 and binaryCheck to build a 2-gate logic AND. pragma circom 2.0.0; template Multiplier2(){ //Declaration of signals signal input in1; signal input in2; signal output out; //Statements. out <== in1 * in2; } template binaryCheck () { //Declaration of signals. signal input in; signal output out; //Statements. in * (in-1) === 0; out <== in; } template And2(){ //Declaration of signals and components. signal input in1; signal input in2; signal output out; component mult = Multiplier2(); component binCheck[2]; //Statements. binCheck[0] = binaryCheck(); binCheck[0].in <== in1; binCheck[1] = binaryCheck(); binCheck[1].in <== in2; mult.in1 <== binCheck[0].out; mult.in2 <== binCheck[1].out; out <== mult.out; } component main = And2(); Simplifying, the 2-gate AND circuit can be defined by the next constraints: in1 * (in1 - 1) = 0 , in2 * (in2 - 1) = 0 , out = in1 * in2 These constraints are satisfiable if and only if in1, in2 are binary signals. Consequently, out will also be binary. Extending our AND logic gate to N inputs Finally, let us build an N-gate logic AND using circuit Multiplier2 and binaryCheck . pragma circom 2.0.0; template binaryCheck () { /*Code from previous example*/ } template Multiplier2 () { /*Code from previous example*/ } template AndN (N){ //Declaration of signals and components. signal input in[N]; signal output out; component mult[N-1]; component binCheck[N]; //Statements. for(var i = 0; i < N; i++){ binCheck[i] = binaryCheck(); binCheck[i].in <== in[i]; } for(var i = 0; i < N-1; i++){ mult[i] = Multiplier2(); } mult[0].in1 <== binCheck[0].out; mult[0].in2 <== binCheck[1].out; for(var i = 0; i < N-2; i++){ mult[i+1].in1 <== mult[i].out; mult[i+1].in2 <== binCheck[i+2].out; } out <== mult[N-2].out; } component main = AndN(4); This program is very similar to MultiplierN , but every signal involved in it is binary. It is important to highlight that we cannot use a (2N-1)-dimensional array to instantiate all the components since, every component of an array must be an instance of the same template with (optionally) different parameters.","title":"Writing and compiling circuits"},{"location":"getting-started/writing-compiling-circuits/#writing-and-compiling-circuits","text":"circom allows programmers to define the constraints that define the arithmetic circuit.

This is to ensure that the circuit is compatible with the compiler version indicated after the pragma instruction. Otherwise, the compiler will throw a warning. Then, we use the reserved keyword template to define our new circuit, called Multiplier2 . Now, we have to define its signals . Signals can be named with an identifier, e.g., in1, in2, out. In this circuit, we have two input signals in1, in2 and an output signal out . Finally, we use <== to set that the value of out is the result of multiplying the values of in1 and in2 . Equivalently, we could have also used the operator ==> , e.g., in1 * in2 ==> out .

To do so, create a file with the following content: pragma circom 2.0.0; template Multiplier2() { signal input a; signal input b; signal output c; c <== a*b; } component main = Multiplier2(); After we write our arithmetic circuit using circom , we should save it in a file with the .circom extension. Remember that you can create your own circuits or use the templates from our library of circuits circomlib . In our example, we create a file called multiplier2.circom . Now is time to compile the circuit to get a system of arithmetic equations representing it. As a result of the compilation we will also obtain programs to compute the witness. We can compile the circuit with the following command: circom multiplier2.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym --c With these options we generate three types of files: --r1cs : it generates the file multiplier2.r1cs that contains the R1CS constraint system of the circuit in binary format. --wasm : it generates the directory multiplier2_js that contains the Wasm code (multiplier2.wasm) and other files needed to generate the witness . --sym : it generates the file multiplier2.sym , a symbols file required for debugging or for printing the constraint system in an annotated mode. --c : it generates the directory multiplier2_cpp that contains several files (multiplier2.cpp, multiplier2.dat, and other common files for every compiled program like main.cpp, MakeFile, etc) needed to compile the C code to generate the witness.

Instantiations of templates are done using the keyword component . We need an instance mult1 to multiply in1 and in2 . In order to assign the values of the input signals of mult1 we use the dot notation \".\" . Once mult1.in1 and mult1.in2 have their values set, then the value of mult1.out is computed.

As we have seen for a 3-input multiplier, we need 3 input signals and 2 components of Multiplier2 . Then, for an N-input multiplier, we need an N-dimensional array of input signals and an \\(N-1\\) -dimensional array of components of Multiplier2 . We also need an integer variable i to instantiate each component comp[i] .
